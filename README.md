This game prototype was created by Justina Ampofo, Evan Brook, and Alex Loomis as a final project for their Game Design class. The game story follows the player, a cat, who is newly adopted into a multicultural family. The player experiences the story through their actions as a cat and may make decisions to experience different scenes based on their choices.
