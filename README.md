# The Family Cat

This game prototype was created for LMC 4725, Game Design.

To play, download the entire repo (keeping the file structure the same) and use the config exe to choose your game settings.

To play the game, right click the mouse to toggle between looking and interacting. Click items to look at or interact with them.

To exit the game, alt-tab out of the window and close the application. (Or, if you're not playing in full screen, close the window)

Thank you for playing!
